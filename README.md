Image Sharing Application created by Nicol√°s Torres

This web application is a simplified image-sharing social platform inspired by services like Pinterest. Users can sign up, upload photos with descriptions and hashtags, like and comment on others posts, and explore content through hashtag-based filtering.

The project is built with Ruby on Rails, applying the MVC architecture, RESTful routing, and clean UI principles. The goal is to combine technical skills and creativity to deliver a functional and engaging user experience.
